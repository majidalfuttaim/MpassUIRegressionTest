# VPN Auto-Reconnection Setup - Summary

## üéâ Successfully Installed!

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Active and Monitoring

## üì¶ What Was Installed

### 1. VPN Auto-Reconnect Script
**Location**: `~/vpn-auto-reconnect.sh`

**Features**:
- Monitors VPN connection every 30 seconds
- Automatically reconnects if VPN drops
- Restarts GitHub Actions runner after reconnection  
- Tests staging environment connectivity
- Comprehensive logging with color-coded output
- Desktop notifications (if terminal-notifier installed)

### 2. LaunchAgent Service
**Location**: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mafid.vpn-auto-reconnect.plist`

**Capabilities**:
- Runs automatically on macOS startup
- Runs in background (no terminal window needed)
- Keeps the monitor running continuously
- Restarts automatically if it crashes

### 3. Log Files
- **Main log**: `~/Library/Logs/vpn-auto-reconnect.log` (rotates at 10MB)
- **Stdout**: `~/Library/Logs/vpn-auto-reconnect-stdout.log`
- **Stderr**: `~/Library/Logs/vpn-auto-reconnect-stderr.log`

## ‚úÖ Current Status

```
VPN Connection:          ‚úÖ Connected (82.212.83.66)
Auto-Reconnect Service:  ‚úÖ Running (PID varies)
GitHub Actions Runner:   ‚úÖ Running (PID varies)
Staging Environment:     ‚úÖ Accessible (HTTP 403)
```

## üîç How It Works

1. **VPN Monitoring**: 
   - Checks VPN status every 30 seconds
   - Detects disconnections immediately
   - Logs health checks every 10th iteration (reduces log noise)

2. **Auto-Reconnection**:
   - Detects VPN disconnect
   - Attempts to reconnect (max 30 seconds)
   - Logs connection details (remote IP, local IP)
   - Sends desktop notification (if available)

3. **Runner Integration**:
   - After VPN reconnects, waits 5 seconds
   - Stops GitHub Actions runner
   - Starts GitHub Actions runner
   - Verifies runner connectivity

4. **Staging Verification**:
   - Tests HTTP connectivity to staging environment
   - Logs success/failure status
   - Expects HTTP 403 response (normal for base URL)

## üìã Common Commands

### View Live Activity
```bash
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/vpn-auto-reconnect.log
```

### Check Service Status
```bash
launchctl list | grep vpn-auto-reconnect
```

### Restart Service
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mafid.vpn-auto-reconnect.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mafid.vpn-auto-reconnect.plist
```

### Check All Status (Quick Monitor)
```bash
cd "/Users/baraissa/Documents/Mpass automation FE"
./monitor-runner.sh
```

### Manual VPN Connection
```bash
scutil --nc start "AmmanOfficeVPN"
```

### Manual Runner Restart
```bash
cd ~/actions-runner && ./svc.sh stop && ./svc.sh start
```

## üéØ Benefits

### Before Auto-Reconnect:
‚ùå VPN disconnects when network changes  
‚ùå Runner loses GitHub connectivity  
‚ùå Tests fail to access staging  
‚ùå Manual reconnection required  
‚ùå Manual runner restart needed

### After Auto-Reconnect:
‚úÖ VPN reconnects automatically  
‚úÖ Runner maintains connectivity  
‚úÖ Tests always access staging  
‚úÖ Zero manual intervention  
‚úÖ Complete audit trail in logs

## üìä Typical Log Output

### Successful Reconnection
```
[2025-10-22 12:46:48] [ERROR] VPN DISCONNECTED! (Disconnect #1)
[2025-10-22 12:46:48] [INFO] Attempting to connect to AmmanOfficeVPN...
[2025-10-22 12:46:54] [SUCCESS] VPN connected successfully!
[2025-10-22 12:46:55] [INFO] VPN Details - Remote: 82.212.83.66, Local IP: 172.25.251.42
[2025-10-22 12:46:55] [INFO] Restarting GitHub Actions runner...
[2025-10-22 12:46:57] [SUCCESS] GitHub Actions runner restarted successfully
[2025-10-22 12:46:58] [INFO] Staging environment accessible (HTTP 403)
```

### Normal Operation (Silent)
```
[2025-10-22 10:34:51] [INFO] VPN health check #10: Connected ‚úì
[2025-10-22 10:39:51] [INFO] VPN health check #20: Connected ‚úì
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If VPN Won't Auto-Reconnect:
1. Ensure VPN password is saved in macOS Keychain
2. Test manual connection: `scutil --nc start "AmmanOfficeVPN"`
3. Check service logs: `cat ~/Library/Logs/vpn-auto-reconnect-stderr.log`

### If Service Not Running:
```bash
# Check status
launchctl list | grep vpn-auto-reconnect

# View errors
cat ~/Library/Logs/vpn-auto-reconnect-stderr.log

# Restart
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mafid.vpn-auto-reconnect.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mafid.vpn-auto-reconnect.plist
```

### If Logs Too Large:
```bash
# Clear logs (they'll be recreated)
rm ~/Library/Logs/vpn-auto-reconnect*.log
```

## üîê Security Notes

1. **VPN Credentials**: Stored securely in macOS Keychain (not in script)
2. **Service Permissions**: Runs as your user (not root)
3. **Log Rotation**: Automatic rotation at 10MB to prevent disk space issues
4. **No Passwords in Logs**: Only connection status and IPs logged

## üìà Testing the Setup

### Simulate VPN Disconnect:
```bash
# Disconnect VPN manually
scutil --nc stop "AmmanOfficeVPN"

# Watch the logs (should auto-reconnect within 30 seconds)
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/vpn-auto-reconnect.log
```

Expected behavior:
1. Monitor detects disconnect within 30 seconds
2. Logs "VPN DISCONNECTED!" error
3. Attempts reconnection
4. Logs "VPN connected successfully!"
5. Restarts runner
6. Logs "GitHub Actions runner restarted successfully"
7. Verifies staging access

2. **Monitor First Automated Run**:
   - Watch: https://github.com/majidalfuttaim/MpassUIRegressionTest/actions
   - Check runner picks up workflow
   - Verify tests pass with VPN access

3. **Test VPN Auto-Reconnection**:
   - Disconnect VPN manually
   - Watch logs to verify auto-reconnect
   - Confirm runner restarts successfully
